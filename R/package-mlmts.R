
#' mlmts: Machine Learning Algorithms for Multivariate Time Series.
#'
#' mlmts provides an implementation of several machine learning algorithms for
#' multivariate time series. The package includes functions allowing the
#' execution of clustering, classification or outlier detection methods,
#' among others. It also incorporates a collection of multivariate time
#' series datasets which can be used to analyse the performance of new
#' proposed algorithms. Practitioners from a broad variety of fields could
#' benefit from the general framework provided by mlmts.
