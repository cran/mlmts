Description: An implementation of several machine learning algorithms for 
    multivariate time series. The package includes functions allowing the
    execution of clustering, classification or outlier detection methods,
    among others. It also incorporates a collection of multivariate time
    series datasets which can be used to analyse the performance of new
    proposed algorithms. Practitioners from a broad variety of fields could
    benefit from the general framework provided by 'mlmts'.
